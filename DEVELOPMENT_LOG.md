# Family Dashboard - Development Log

## Project Overview
**Created**: August 8, 2025  
**Developer**: Paul Edwards (Brisbane, Australia)  
**AI Assistant**: Amazon Q Developer  
**Purpose**: Weekly family dashboard for pocket money, planning, and reflection  

## Family Requirements Gathered
- **Family Size**: Parents + 3 children (Leni 10, Ayda 7, Finn 4)
- **Meeting Schedule**: Sunday evenings, 30 minutes
- **Display**: Cast to TV for family meetings
- **Budget**: $0 hosting cost requirement
- **Approach**: Barefoot Investor for Kids methodology
- **Integration Needs**: Google Calendar, Photos, Tasks

## Technical Decisions Made

### Architecture Choices
1. **React.js**: Chosen for interactive components and real-time updates
2. **GitHub Pages**: Selected over AWS Amplify for true $0 forever hosting
3. **Static Site**: Decided to start static, add backend later if needed
4. **CSS Themes**: Custom theme system over external libraries for performance

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Pocket Money Tracker**
   - Individual job tracking per child
   - Barefoot Investor allocation (charity/savings/spending)
   - Real-time calculation of earnings
   - Parent matching for charity donations

2. **Theme System**
   - 8 weekly rotating themes
   - Automatic theme switching based on week number
   - Kid-friendly themes (Harry Potter, Paw Patrol, Bluey, etc.)
   - CSS custom properties for dynamic theming

3. **Interactive Components**
   - Job completion checkboxes
   - Money allocation sliders/inputs
   - Photo slideshow with navigation
   - Task completion tracking

   - Sync with family schedules

3. **Google Tasks API**
   - Connect to family task lists
   - Enable task creation/completion
   - Sync across family devices
   - Add task assignment features

### Phase 5: Data Persistence
1. **Local Storage Enhancement**
   - Save family settings
